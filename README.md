# FinalProjectAI
Dataset, python code, and results after creating an AI.

The python code extracts a zip file (dataset) from a Google Drive. I imagine any person wanting to implement the code must change these lines of code, or specify the route of the zip file in order for it to work.

Also, the .ipybn file is also included â€”it can be changed into a Jupiter Notebook too for flexibility; however the intrested person must manually do said changes.
The resulting CSV file is also included.
