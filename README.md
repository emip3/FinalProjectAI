# FinalProjectAI
Dataset, python code, and results after creating an AI.

The python code extracts a zip file (dataset) from a Google Drive. I imagine any person wanting to implement the code must change these lines of code, or specify the route of the zip file in order for it to work.

Also, the .ipybn file is also included â€”it can be changed into a Jupiter Notebook too for flexibility; however the intrested person must manually do said changes.

Since the .zip file is so big, here is the Google Drive url to download it:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Blhh_G2MRH7TUquwwuqJf5ME7n6kgTmz/view?usp=drive_link

And here is the Google Colab Notebook url with the Python (.ipybn):

Finally, within this repository, is a prediction after running the model and adding another image to predict the class of it.
